# Flower-John
The Chinese pronunciation for flower is "hua" and "hua john" sounds the same as the Chinese pronunciation for makeup, so we named our makeup program "Flower John".

## Problem to Solve
Modern people like to use filters, but every time you need to click on the screen to control the program, so we made a makeup program that can use gestures to control it. You can use gestures to control the program. We trained the recognize gestures model using yolov4.

## How to Use?
### 1. Manual select effects or Gestures select effects

### 2. Take a picture with entering 'a' or your hand in the 'ok' sign
